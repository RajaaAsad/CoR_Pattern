# CoR_Pattern
•	This project explains how to handle emails using the chain of responsibility pattern.

•	There are many types of emails, and each type has a particular team to handle it. So, we created a system using CoR Pattern that decided which is the best team to work on this email. For example, if it is a kickstart email the system decides that the recruitment Officer is the target team.
